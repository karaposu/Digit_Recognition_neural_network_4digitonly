# Digit_Recognition_neural_network_4digitonly

This is my second project about neural network . My main objective was to recognize the digits which includes  paint created ones. First i thought mnist data was enough for that. But i was wrong. Mnist data are real handwritten images and the characteristic of that data is seriously different from paint created images.. That is why it failed. 

Shivang Srivastava says it is because of this :
The thickness of the image is too thin which does not match our training data. As the MNSIT dataset consists of atleast 45% of the character in the entire image.

Anyway i created 200 pictures from paint and wirte a code to add them to mnist dataset. Since my obj was to understand the mechanics of neural training i only created 4 class dataset. just 4 digits. all are jpg format.  With this much i have  75 percentage success .
